# Open Shiba Community
Hello and welcome to the Open Shiba Foundation. This is the place to start if you're interested in helping out any of our projects, or starting a new [Shiba](https://www.shibatoken.com/) project of your own.

## Who Can Help?
[Shiba](https://www.shibatoken.com/) as a tool is young, and we as Open Shiba are even younger. As more projects come to life, we'll be looking for all types people to help out with any number of avenues

### Build:
If you have a project you need a home for, or want to help with existing open-souce projects, we'd love to have you!

### Design and UX:
We all love pretty things, and we love the people who make things pretty even more! Help us look our best! And if it isn't intuitive and easy to use, nobody will use it. Come Halp!

### QA:
There's nothing more frustring than technology that doesn't work. We'll take all the help we can get testing new products before they go live!

### Publicity:
Shiba is a young community without a tradional company behind it to help with advertising budgets and marketing specialist, we need the community to rise up behind it, and help it reach it's potential.

### Shiba Community:
If you're good at organizing and working with people, there's all sorts of community management and outreach efforts we could use help with.

### Charity & Giving Back:
As a community we would love to continue to find more ways to give back, and help make the world a little better place. With recent press around Shiba donations, let's keep the good will train going, and find more ways to use Shiba for Good.

to help keep requests going, and ensure there's enough administrators that there's no risk of the project by any individual contributor.
